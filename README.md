This application is based on GraphQL API Services where there is a single route/endpoint that:-

1. Serves to multiple queries from the frontend/Client Side..
2. Every request is made based on query/mutations/Subscriptions(Used for notification like features..)
3. Retrieves Custom Responses rather providing full payload thereby helps in performance optimisation.

Since this is a complete backend project as there is no front end involved, the tasks/features can be tested through a platform called GraphQL PLAYGROUND.

GrapQL PLAYGROUND is a cool feature which helps in testing our backend implementation then & there. It greatly helps in reduced time consumption for development thereby contributing increased productivity.

Bonus Tasks Done:
• Deployed to Heroku.
